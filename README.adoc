== Simple PCM Audio player for Arduino101 and similar (Intel Curie chip) ==

Deployed for the fist time for @amicoleo wedding :)

== Make it run ==

Create a 16bit, 16000Hz wav file using Audacity, get its filesize and upload on the 101 using the uploader sketch

Then, connect a buzzer with by placing its "data" pin on pin6 (I had a three legs one so I powered it from pins 4 and 5).
Upload the player and enjoy the tune!
